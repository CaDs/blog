# About

I'm a developer who enjoys building things and sharing what I learn along the way.

This blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Bear Blog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) theme, and hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/).

I write about web development, DevOps, and tools I find useful. Check out the [Thoughts](/blog/) for my latest posts.
