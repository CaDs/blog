# Carlos Donderis

I'm **Carlos Donderis**, usually known as **CaDs**. I'm a Spanish 🇪🇸 engineering leader and storyteller living in Tokyo, Japan 🇯🇵, currently working as the VP of Engineering at [Mercari Japan](https://twitter.com/mercari_jp).

I write about technology, lately about AI-related topics, engineering leadership, and, in general, topics I find interesting. 

Check out my [Thoughts](/blog/) for the latest posts.
